# LTspice comparison: Ideal vs Practical (1N4148-like) diode

This repository contains two LTspice-compatible netlists and simulation artifacts comparing an ideal diode approximation with a practical 1N4148-like SPICE diode. The provided netlists are `ideal_diode.cir` and `real_diode.cir` (place them in LTspice and run a DC sweep of V1 from -1 V to +1 V).

Summary (comparison):
The ideal diode model switches instantly at 0 V and introduces no forward voltage drop; when forward-biased the current is solely set by the circuit around it (here I = Vin/R). The practical 1N4148 shows a continuous exponential I-V characteristic described by the diode equation; it develops a forward voltage (about 0.5–0.9 V depending on current) and limited current for a given source/resistor because of its exponential law and series resistance. In reverse bias the practical diode leaks small current and may avalanche at high reverse voltage, while the ideal model clamps leakage to zero. The ideal model is useful for hand-analysis and early-stage design because it simplifies math and highlights topology-level behavior. It becomes inaccurate when forward drop, reverse leakage, dynamic resistance, speed (reverse recovery), or thermal effects materially affect performance — for example, precision clamp levels, low-voltage power paths, and high-speed switching where stored charge matters. Use the real diode model (or manufacturer SPICE model) for final verification and thermal/current derating checks.
