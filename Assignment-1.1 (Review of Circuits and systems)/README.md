## 8. Define electricity and electronics in your own words. Highlight the key differences between the two terms.

**Electricity** is the flow of electric charge used to produce energy for operating devices such as lights, heaters, and motors.

**Electronics** is the field that deals with controlling and manipulating electrical signals to process information using electronic components.

### Key Differences
- Electricity focuses on **power and energy transfer**.
- Electronics focuses on **control, signals, and information processing**.
- Electricity involves high power systems, while electronics uses low power circuits.

## 9. Choose a specific electronic device or system and explain how electronics contribute to its functionality. Highlight the role of electronic components.

A **smartphone** is a common electronic device that heavily depends on electronics for its functionality.

Electronics enable a smartphone to process data, communicate, and interact with users. The **microprocessor (CPU)** acts as the brain, executing instructions. **Transistors** inside the processor switch and amplify signals. **Capacitors and resistors** manage voltage and current flow. **Sensors** (touch, camera, motion) convert physical actions into electrical signals.

Without electronics, smartphones would not be able to compute, store data, or communicate.

## 10. Explain the scope of electricity and electronics, providing examples of applications for each.

### Scope of Electricity
Electricity is mainly used in power generation, transmission, and utilization.
**Examples:**
- Power plants and electric grids
- Electric motors and generators
- Household appliances (fans, heaters, lights)

### Scope of Electronics
Electronics is used in control systems, communication, and automation.
**Examples:**
- Computers and smartphones
- Medical equipment
- Industrial automation and robotics
- Communication systems (radio, TV, internet)
